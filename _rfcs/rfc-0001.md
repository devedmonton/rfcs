# Abstract

# Participate

* [Fork or file issues on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs/blob/master/_rfcs/rfc-0001.md)

# Status

This proposal has outstanding issues to address.

The Society is currently "dog fooding" this process and looking for feedback from key stakeholders, members, and Working Group Champions. Send feedback to mark@devedmonton.com, or [create a pull request and file issues on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs).

This process will be reviewed with a plan to become an official process in August 2020.

# Motivation

As a society we want to improve the lives of Edmonton developers as much as possible, enriching the broader community through them. We believe that the Dev Society membership is in the best position to decide how to achieve this objective, and want to make it as simple as possible for developers to help themselves.

The Request For Collaboration process allows any member to put forward an idea for a process, standard, or best practice for sharing and adoption by the entire Edmonton developer community.

It's the hope that during this process the RFC is shaped and polished through constructive feedback and collaborative with the community, and with the suport of a Working Group, until concensus can be found and an optimal RFC is realized.

Once realized RFCs should be static and maintained for historical purposes, however newer RFCs may obsolete old ones. If deemed no longer useful then they may also be deprecated.

# Background

The Dev Edmonton Society seeks to be as collaborative and open as possible with it's members, developers, and the broader community. We believe open collaboration benefits everyone by building concensus, and that many eyes improve the quality of the end result.

Many other organizations (Python, ECMAScript, Go, Java, IETF, W3C, etc.) rely on a Request For Comments process to gather input from many implementors and experts as the build new technical processes and standards. Given our members technical backgrounds we feel it's reasonable to assume that they may be familiar with these kind of processes already, and as such would be comfortable using RFCs to collaborate.

The editors of this process thought it important to name our implementation a Request For Collaboration, rather than Request For Comment, as it places the emphasise on an active process between peers, rather than a more one-way conversation. We hope this spirit of collaboration is celebrated and encouraged throughout the RFC process as our members experience it.

# Outstanding Issues

* In which case should a finished RFC be updated? (Formatting, deprecation, retirement, etc.)
* Are finished RFCs static and replaced by a new RFC, or updated?

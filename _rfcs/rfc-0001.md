# Motivation

As a society we want to improve the lives of Edmonton developers as much as possible, enriching the broader community through them. Working Groups allow all Dev Edmonton Society members to quickly and effectively perform interesting work of their choosing.

Working Groups keep the work of DES open, collaborative, and welcoming to members of all abilities, interest, and availability.

DES provides Working Groups with resources, a platform, and shared experience to empower members.

In the past, the Board, along with a small adhoc group of members, has done most of the day-to-day work of the Society. The Working Groups are succeeding if the majority of the Society's work leaves the Board and is instead taken up by the Working Groups.

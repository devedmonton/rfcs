# Abstract

A Request For Collaboration, or RFC, is a document used by the Dev Edmonton Society to develop and share decisions, process, standards, and best practices amongst our members and the broader community.

This document describes in detail the motivation for the RFC process, what an RFC is, and how they're developed and shared. It also contemplates alternative processes and links to other pertinent reference material.

# Participate

* [Fork or file issues on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs/blob/master/_rfcs/rfc-0001.md)
* [TODO: Discuss on the society mailing list](#)

# Status

This proposal has outstanding issues to address.

The Society is currently "dog fooding" this process and looking for feedback from key stakeholders, members, and Working Group Champions. Send feedback to mark@devedmonton.com, or [create a pull request and file issues on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs).

This process will be reviewed with a plan to become an official process in August 2020.

# Motivation

The Dev Edmonton Society seeks to be as collaborative and open as possible with it's members, developers, and the broader community. We believe open collaboration benefits everyone by building concensus, and that many eyes improve the quality of the end result.

The Request For Collaboration process allows any member to champion an idea or project they're passionate about. The content of each RFC is unique but usually documents a decision, process, standard or best practice.

It's our hope that during the RFC process each idea is shaped and polished through constructive feedback and collaborative with the community, and with the support of a Working Group, until concensus can be found and an optimal RFC is realized.

RFCs also act as our shared societal memory, allowing all members to reflect on past decisions and understand how the Society has come to be.

# Background

Many other organizations (Python, ECMAScript, Go, Java, IETF, W3C, etc.) rely on a Request For Comments process to gather input from many implementors and experts as they develop new technical processes and standards. Given our members technical backgrounds it's reasonable to assume that they may be familiar with these kind of processes already, and as such would be comfortable using RFCs to collaborate. The Society if grateful to these organizations for their guidance and examples. You can find a full list of all these processes in the references section.

The editors of this process thought it important to name our implementation a Request For Collaboration, rather than Request For Comment, as it places the emphasise on an active process between peers, rather than a more one-way conversation. We hope this spirit of collaboration is celebrated and encouraged throughout the RFC process as our members experience it. Finding a concensus is the end goal.

All RFCs are driven by a Working Group who supports the work of the RFC Champion, and ultimately they approve the final RFC. Each Working Group has a specific area of authority, and are typically also made up of the members who will implement or are affected by the RFC. If no Working Group exists to authorize the work of an RFC then one should be created to do this, or the RFC withdrawn. See [RFC-0002](./rfc-0002.html) for a list of the current working groups and how to start one.

# What Is an RFC

In essence an RFC represents a decision, process, standard, or best practice that the Society is exploring.

Depending on the stage of the RFC it may have just been proposed, or it may have been thoroughly reviewed and accepted. Some RFCs may also be withdrawn, or deprecated and superseded by other work.

RFCs document the learnings and knowledge of the Society, and provide insight into both why we do, and why we don't. Each RFC should reflect the various, sometimes opposing, opinions around the RFC and seek to build concensus. That doesn't neccesarily mean that all Society members will agree with an RFC, but ideally those that don't can at least understand and support it. It's the RFC Champions job to collaborate with the community and build this concensus with the support of the Working Group and Board.

RFCs are implemented and authorized by the various Working Groups that carry out the actions of the Society. In a few cases RFCs will impact the entire Society as a whole. In these cases the Society as a whole with authorize and implement the RFC, under guidance from The Board. It's the role of the Board to determine which Working Group has authority over an RFC, and RFC author's to seek this clarification before proposing a new RFC. Should a dispute arise over which Working Group oversees an RFC the Board has final authority to resolve this.

** NOTE: This section is very draft and will probably change as we figure out how much we want in the repo, and how much we want to do in GitHub pull requests. **

Each RFC has a status which changes over it's lifetime.

When first put forward all RFCs begin as a proposal. Once the Champion has completed preparing the RFC they can request a Working Group to accept it as a draft and formally begin developing it. To do so the Champion must submit the proposal on the working group mailing list where Working Group members vote on it. If approved it formally becomes a draft RFC and becomes part of the regular Working Group agenda. During this time the Champion is expected to provide regular updates, integrate feedback, and generally find concensus.

After the Champion is satisfied concensus on the RFC has been reached they can pubmit the draft RFC to the Working Group mailing list. Again Working Group members vote. If approved the RFC becomes active and should be implemented. If the vote fails then work on the RFC can continue or it can be withdrawn. Accepted RFCs then remain in affect until they are deprecated or superseded by another RFC in the future.

Any changes to the status of an RFC should be shared on the Working Group mailing list, and the RFC updated in [the Society's RFC repository on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs).

# The Champion

Each RFC has a Champion who is ultimately responsible for the content of the RFC.

The Champion's role is to advocate for and build concensus around an RFC, and they decide when to propose it to a Working Group, when to request a Working Group accept it, or when to withdraw it if concensus is not going to be reached.

The Champion may not be the only author of each RFC, but they do have final say on what their RFC includes. When accepting changes, it's up to the Champion to decide which are included or not.

Being a Champion is a serious responsiblity, and for an RFC to succeed they have a responsiblity to work to build concensus whenever possible. Find common ground, and when neccesary split more contentious RFCs in to smaller more agreeable ones instead. Rely on the Working Group, and when neccesary the Board for support in doing this. It's what they're there for.

From time to time a Champion will lose interest in an RFC. This is normal and expected. We've all got busy lives and no one is to blame.

In this case it's expected that the Champion will abandon the RFC and allow another Champion to step forward or Withdraw the RFC if one cannot be found. In circumstances where a Champion cannot be contacted after a reasonable effort, then a Working Group can elect a new Champion to replace them or vote to withraw the RFC on their behalf.

# Proposing an RFC

Any member can submit a proposal by [forking the Dev Edmonton Society RFC repository and creating a pull request](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs). Members are welcome to use GitHub's Draft Pull Request feature if they would like to share their work prior to it being ready for voting on by a Working Group.

Questions to answer in an RFC include:

* Can you describe this RFC in one or two sentences?
* Why do we need this RFC?
* Who does this RFC impact?
* Which Working Group will guide and approve this RFC? (Board has oversight, so seek input if needed)
* What background do you need to understand this RFC? Is this documenting an existing practice?
* Does the Working Group have enough information to implement this RFC?
* Which issues are outstanding? Do they prevent concensus or implementation?
* Have alternatives and dissenting opinions been documented and considered?
* Are there other groups doing something similar? What can we learn from their experience?
* What references help understand and provide context for this RFC?
* Can this RFC be broken down into two or more smaller RFCs instead?

Once you're ready to champion your proposal with a Working Group create your pull request, or remove the draft flag from your pull request, and ask for a review. An RFC maintainer will then review your pull request for formatting and style, then assign an RFC number and merge your RFC. You're RFC will now appear as a proposal on [the DES RFC website](https://devedmonton.com/rfcs/)! Nice work! :)

Send a message to the Working Group mailing list requesting a vote on accepting your RFC into draft, with a link to the proposal on [the DES RFC website](https://devedmonton.com/rfcs/). Contact the Working Group Steward or a Board Member if you need help doing this. Working Group members then have two weeks to vote on the RFC at which point it will either be accepted or not.

If your RFC is accepted into draft then the Working Group has agreed to support it. Move onto the [Drafting the RFC](#drafting-the-rfc) section for details on what that means.

If your RFC is not accepted, then you have a decision to make. Are there changes you can make to find concensus so the Working Group will accpet it, or should you withdraw this RFC? You're also welcome to propose one or more new RFCs to replace this one in the future. As the RFC Champion this decision is on you. See [Withdrawing an RFC](#withdrawing-an-rfc) for details on how to do this.

# Drafting the RFC

An RFC that's in draft has now been formally taken on by a Working Group, and should be considered part of the standing agenda at Working Group meetings and in project management tools. On a regular basis the Champion should provide the Working Group with updates, and the Working Group should help mentor and guide the Champion in finding concensus and direction for their RFC.

Working Groups should remember that not all Champions will have experience drafting an RFC, and more experienced members should provide support and guidence whenever possible.

Together the Champion and Working Group should challenge each other to create the best RFC possible, so that it will be ready for a vote to be accepted and implemented.

# Approving an RFC

All RFCs follow the same approval process regardless of the Working Group overseeing them. This ensures that all members understand the approval process for new RFCs, and each is given the same time and consideration before being accepted.

As with other RFC processes, an RFC must be submitted for approval to a Working Group mailing list and on the Working Groups Slack. Working Group members then have two weeks to discuss and vote. At the end of the two weeks votes are tallied and the RFC will be accepted or remain in draft. As the objective of each RFC is to build concensus a two-thirds majority is neccessary for an RFC to be approved.

It's the expectation of the Society that at this point the RFCs authors either address feedback and submit for approval again, or accept that concensus will not be reached and withdraw the proposal.

# Withdrawing an RFC

An RFCs author may at any time choose to withdraw an RFC that has not been accepted. This signals that work on the RFC has stopped, and a new RFC must be stared should work in a similar area resume.

Withdrawn RFCs are recorded and maintained for posterity. The issues and information they contain is valuable and can assist with building concensus for other RFCs in the future.

Withdrawing an RFC is a standard and reasonable part of the RFC process. For example, during complex decision making multiple RFCs can be put forward and championed by different members of the community (as was the case for the Python organization when establishing the new Benevalent Dictator For Life processes). By having multiple RFCs, each can be fully explored and discussed, and alternatives withdrawn when the chosen RFC is approved.

To withdraw an RFC update the RFC on the RFC GitHub repo (or submit a PR to do so), and then post on the Working Group mailing list indicating the RFC has been withdrawn. It would be helpful to indicate in the updated RFC and in your post why the RFC was withdrawn as other's may pursue similiar work in the future.

# Superseding an existing RFC

# Deprecating an RFC

# Stages of an RFC

# Outstanding Issues

* In which case should a finished RFC be updated? (Formatting, deprecation, retirement, etc.)
* Are finished RFCs static and replaced by a new RFC, or updated?
* Do all Working Groups need to follow the same process to approve new RFCs?
* Does the Board need to approve each RFC?
* Does the Board need to approve which Working Group approves each RFC?
* How does one vote on an RFC? (We should look to see how PEP, TC39, etc. handle this.)
* The PEP process has a concept of deferred RFCs which have been abandoned by their authors and are no longer being developed. Do we need this status, or can we just withdraw the RFC and a new one be created later?

# Abstract

# Participate

* [Fork or file issues on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs/blob/master/_rfcs/rfc-0001.md)

# Status

This proposal has outstanding issues to address.

The Society is currently "dog fooding" this process and looking for feedback from key stakeholders, members, and Working Group Champions. Send feedback to mark@devedmonton.com, or [create a pull request and file issues on GitHub](https://github.com/devedmonton/rfcs).

This process will be reviewed with a plan to become an official process in August 2020.

# Motivation

As a society we want to improve the lives of Edmonton developers as much as possible, enriching the broader community through them. We believe that the Dev Society membership is in the best position to decide how to achieve this objective, and want to make it as simple as possible for developers to help themselves.

The Request For Collaboration process allows any member to put forward an idea for a process, standard, or best practice for sharing and adoption by the entire Edmonton developer community.

It's the hope that during this process the RFC is shaped and polished through constructive feedback and collaborative with the community, and with the suport of a Working Group, until concensus can be found and an optimal RFC is realized.

Once realized RFCs should be static and maintained for historical purposes, however newer RFCs may obsolete old ones. If deemed no longer useful then they may also be deprecated.

# Background

The Dev Edmonton Society seeks to be as collaborative and open as possible with it's members, developers, and the broader community. We believe open collaboration benefits everyone by building concensus, and that many eyes improve the quality of the end result.

Many other organizations (Python, ECMAScript, Go, Java, IETF, W3C, etc.) rely on a Request For Comments process to gather input from many implementors and experts as they develop new technical processes and standards. Given our members technical backgrounds we feel it's reasonable to assume that they may be familiar with these kind of processes already, and as such would be comfortable using RFCs to collaborate.

The editors of this process thought it important to name our implementation a Request For Collaboration, rather than Request For Comment, as it places the emphasise on an active process between peers, rather than a more one-way conversation. We hope this spirit of collaboration is celebrated and encouraged throughout the RFC process as our members experience it.

All RFCs are driven by a Working Group who supports, champions the development of, and ultimately authorizes the final RFC. Each Working Group has a specific area of authority, and are typically also made up of the members who will implement or are affected by the RFC. If no Working Group exists to authorize the work of an RFC then one should be created to do this, or the RFC withdrawn. See [RFC-0002](./rfc-0002.html) for a list of the current working groups and how to start one.

# What Is an RFC

# Proposing an RFC

# Drafting the RFC

# Approving an RFC

All RFCs follow the same approval process regardless of the Working Group overseeing them. This ensures that all members understand the approval process for new RFCs, and each is given the same time and consideration before being accepted.

As with other RFC processes, an RFC must be submitted for approval to a Working Group mailing list and on the Working Groups Slack. Working Group members then have two weeks to discuss and vote. At the end of the two weeks votes are tallied and the RFC will be accepted or remain in draft. As the objective of each RFC is to build concensus a two-thirds majority is neccessary for an RFC to be approved.

It's the expectation of the Society that at this point the RFCs authors either address feedback and submit for approval again, or accept that concensus will not be reached and withdraw the proposal.

# Withdrawing an RFC

An RFCs author may at any time choose to withdraw an RFC that has not been accepted. This signals that work on the RFC has stopped, and a new RFC must be stared should work in a similar area resume.

Withdrawn RFCs are recorded and maintained for posterity. The issues and information they contain is valuable and can assist with building concensus for other RFCs in the future.

Withdrawing an RFC is a standard and reasonable part of the RFC process. For example, during complex decision making multiple RFCs can be put forward and championed by different members of the community (as was the case for the Python organization when establishing the new Benevalent Dictator For Life processes). By having multiple RFCs, each can be fully explored and discussed, and alternatives withdrawn when the chosen RFC is approved.

# Superseding an existing RFC

# Deprecating an RFC

# Stages of an RFC

# Outstanding Issues

* In which case should a finished RFC be updated? (Formatting, deprecation, retirement, etc.)
* Are finished RFCs static and replaced by a new RFC, or updated?
* Do all Working Groups need to follow the same process to approve new RFCs?
* Does the Board need to approve each RFC?
* Does the Board need to approve which Working Group approves each RFC?
* How does one vote on an RFC? (We should look to see how PEP, TC39, etc. handle this.)

# Acknowledgements

This process is heavily inspired by the Working Groups of other organizations like the W3C, IEEE, and TC39. We'd like to acknowledge their work which stand as a model for the process outlined here.

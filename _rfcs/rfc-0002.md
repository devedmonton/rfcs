# Abstract

This outlines a process by which the Dev Edmonton Society creates and maintains a set of Working Groups.

Each Working Group carries out a function of significance to DES, and with the support of DES resources. Individual working groups can follow their own processes but all have a steward who overseas their work, along with published communications, meetings, and other resources.

# Motivation

The Dev Edmonton Society was founded with the belief that an empowered and vibrant developer community enriches all Edmontonians. As part of this vision, we believe that empowering our members to better help themselves and become involed in the work of the society and the community as a whole is our primary mandate.

Rather than accomplishing this through the work of the Board of Governers, we'd rather provide tools and resources for members to grow and achieve things on their own.

Over time it's become clear that given the massive size of the Edmonton developer community it's unlikely that the Board of Directors has the resources to even faciliate all the projects we'd like to.

With this in mind, we're suggesting that we make it simpler for society members to take on an active role in the society's current work, and to shape the direction of the society's work and resources in the future.

Working Groups represent the simplest and most direct way that society members can contribute to the Edmonton development community and the work DES does to grow and support developers in Edmonton.

# Background

The work of the society has been focused on a few key areas, designed to maximize the return on the effort of society members in growing and supporting the Edmonton developer community.

In the past this work has been constrained by the resources and time of the society's Board of Directors who have performed all of the strategic and day-to-day operations of society. Working Groups tranistion these activities from the Board members into working groups that contain members of the society and the community at large.

Working Groups, sometimes called Special Interest Groups or SIGs, are not an idea unique to the Dev Edmonton Society and have been used by other groups such as the IEEE, W3C, Python, and other academic, technical, and social groups to focus and align the efforts of large organizations. Inspired by these groups and by collecting members with shared interests together, and empowering them with the resources they need to succeeed, it is the hope of the Society to do more work, and in a more visible and impactful way.

# Anatomy of a Working Group

Each Working Group is made up of a group of society members who work together to achieve a specific goal. This goal can be on-going, such as providing support for local meetup organizers, or targetted towards a specific outcome, such as bringing a specific conference or technology to Edmonton.

By forming a Working Group members benefit from official support of the Dev Edmonton Society and it's resources. This includes access to:

 * hold funds in the Dev Edmonton Society bank account
 * make use of emails at the @devedmonton.com domain
 * mailing lists
 * official Slack channels
 * and any other resources DES has to offer

Working Groups may choose to meet and organize using the tools and procedures they see fit, however we ask that they share these in as open, collaborative and welcoming way as possible, not-with-standing the right to privacy and resources available to DES to do so. If a working group meets on a regular basis, we encourage them to share the schedule and calendar so that interested members may get involved.

The idea is that Working Groups make it easy for members of the society to help and engage with work their pasionate with.

# Creating A New Working Group

Any member of the society can put forward a motion to create a new working group at a meeting of the Board of Governors or AGM. Should the motion pass, then the Working Group will be created and added to the list maintained by the Society.

# Retiring A Working Group

As the objectives of a Working Group are met, or the work is deemed no longer valuable by members of the Society then a motion dissolving the Working Group can be put forward by any member of the Society at a meeting of the Board or at the AGM.

In the event that a Working Group is dissolved, then every effort will be made to archive and preserve the records and work of the Working Group for posterity, within limits deemed reasonable by the Board.

# Outstanding Issues

* What is a reasonable threshold of support required to start a new Working Group?
* What other resources are required to run a typical Working Group?
* Do all working groups need to report to the Board? How and when?
* Do you need to be a society member to join a working group?
* Does it make sense for some of the meetups to start Working Groups to run them?

# Abstract

This outlines a process by which the Dev Edmonton Society creates and maintains a set of Working Groups, along with a list of the active working groups.

Each Working Group carries out a function of significance to DES, and with the support of DES resources. Individual working groups can follow their own processes but all have a steward who overseas their work, along with published communications, meetings, and other resources.

# Status

This propsal is a draft with outstanding issues to address. The Society is currently implementing this process and looking for feedback from key stakeholders and Working Group stewards. Send feedback to mark@devedmonton.com.

This process will be reviewed with a plan to ratify in August 2020.

# Motivation

Put simply, as a society we want to make as big a difference as possible in the lives of Edmonton developers and the broader community. Working Groups allow all Dev Edmonton Society members to quickly and effectively perform interesting work of their choosing in a simple and collaborative way. DES provides these Working Groups with resources, a platform, and shared experience to make this possible.

# Background

The Dev Edmonton Society was founded with the belief that an empowered and vibrant developer community enriches all Edmontonians. As part of this vision, we believe that empowering our members to better help themselves and become involed in the work of the society and the community as a whole is our primary mandate.

In the past this work has been constrained by the resources and time of the society's Board of Directors who have performed all of the strategic and day-to-day operations of society. Working Groups tranistion these activities out the Board and into working groups that contain members of the society and the community at large.

They also make this work more visible and accessible to members that may want to get involved in their communtiy and the work of the Society but don't know what's happening on the best way to get involved.

The idea of Working Groups, sometimes called Special Interest Groups or SIGs, are not unique to the Dev Edmonton Society and have been used by other groups such as the IEEE, W3C, Python, and other academic, technical, and social groups to focus and align the efforts of large organizations. Inspired by these groups and by collecting members with shared interests together, and empowering them with the resources they need to succeeed, it is the hope of the Society to do more work, and in a more visible and impactful way.

# Anatomy of a Working Group

The idea is that Working Groups make it easy for members of the society to help and engage with work they're pasionate with.

Each Working Group is made up of a group of society members who work together to achieve a specific goal. This goal can be on-going, such as providing support for local meetup organizers, or targetted towards a specific outcome, such as bringing a specific conference or technology to Edmonton.

The work of the Working Group is moved forward by a group of members, however at any one time a single steward is selected by the Working Group to chair meetings and provide a single point of contact for other members, the community, and the Board. Should the Working Group lose it's steward then another member may step forward to take their place, or the Working Group can elect to dissolve. All Working Groups should have a steward.

By forming a Working Group members benefit from official support of the Dev Edmonton Society and it's resources. This includes access to:

 * hold funds in the Dev Edmonton Society bank account
 * make use of emails at the @devedmonton.com domain
 * create and use mailing lists
 * share events using the DES Eventbrite account
 * the official Slack channels, on a Slack with over 1000 members
 * GitHub organization
 * Clubhouse project management account
 * event recording hardware and expertise
 * and any other resources DES has to offer

Working Groups may choose to meet and organize using the tools and procedures they see fit, however we ask that they share these in as open, collaborative and welcoming way as possible, not-with-standing the right to privacy and resources available to DES to do so. If a working group meets on a regular basis, we encourage them to share the schedule and calendar so that interested members may get involved. Most Working Groups choose to either do all work asynchronously using the mailing list and Slack channel, or to meet on a monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly schedule.

Working Groups are encouraged to use a mailing list, Github repository, or project management tool to share discussions and decisions made. A website or Google Drive folder is the recommended way to share information and files with other members and the public. Please remember that messages on Slack are not permenant and everything posted there will disappear after a month or so.

# Creating A New Working Group

Any member of the society can put forward a motion to create a new working group at a meeting of the Board of Governors or AGM. Should the motion pass, then the Working Group will be created and added to the list maintained by the Society.

# Retiring A Working Group

As the objectives of a Working Group are met, or the work is deemed no longer valuable by members of the Society then a motion dissolving the Working Group can be put forward by any member of the Society at a meeting of the Board or at the AGM.

In the event that a Working Group is dissolved, then every effort will be made to archive and preserve the records and work of the Working Group for posterity, within limits deemed reasonable by the Board.

# Outstanding Issues

* What is a reasonable threshold of support required to start a new Working Group?
* What other resources are required to run a typical Working Group?
* Do all working groups need to report to the Board? How and when?
* Do you need to be a society member to join a working group?
* Does it make sense for some of the meetups to start Working Groups to run them?

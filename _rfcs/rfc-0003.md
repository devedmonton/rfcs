# Abstract

As the society has grown, we've recognized the need for a more permanent and long form discussion and collaboration amongst Dev Edmonton Society members, which complements the ephemeral and real-time discussions taking place on our Slack.

Specifically we're looking for a forum to allow Working Groups to conduct their business and vote on RFCs and motions. We're also looking for a venue where discussion can be archived and referenced in the future. This is unlike Slack where messages are lost after a week or so.

Given the size of our community whatever platform we use for discussions also needs to support community building and moderation in line with our Code of Conduct and Alberta laws. We also need to ensure that support for the platform is available in the future, that it's within our budget, and aligns with our broader values and objectives. As business of a private or sensitive nature may be discussed from time-to-time, we also need to be able to conduct private discussions.

We also need to make sure that it's easy for members to join the discussion using their existing profiles on GitHub or Google, as well as by registering an account with email and a password.

Some members also prefer to enage with the community through email, so being able to subscribe to and participate in discussions via email is important.

We've reviewed multiple solutions for our discussion lists, and are recommending Discourse based on it's ease of use, community building, moderation, permission, support, and hosting costs.

# Status

This proposal has outstanding issues to address and has not yet been put forward for a working group to accept.

# Working Group

Given that the discussion list will be used by the entire society we're proposing that The Board will accept and support this RFC. This proposal has not yet been put forward or accepted by any Working Group.

# Motivation

As a society we have lots of great discussions about everything from Working Group business to development and random conversation. Normally these discussion happen in real-time on Slack and are lost after a week or so. This works well sometimes, but other kinds of collaboration calls for longer form and more developed discussion that can be reviewed and referenced again in the future. In these cases Slack is not an ideal solution.

Slack also doesn't serve us well when making announcements and sharing other news, as if you're not on Slack in the days immediately following the announcement you'll miss out.

# Background

DO I NEED TO KEEP THIS SECTION?

# Evaluation Criteria

We're evaluating discussion list solutions on the following merits.

## Community Building

Growing the Edmonton developer community, and fostering what already exists is a key goal of the Dev Edmonton Society. As such, the discussion list needs to enable whenever possible.

### Sign Up & On Boarding

Users initial experience has a heavy influence on their perception of a product or service as a whole. If we want to present a welcoming and friendly community to new members, it's important that the sign up process is simple, with as few steps as possible.

We also want to ensure that new users are guided through their first interactions with the discussion list and understand the features of the platform, and the community and behavioural norms expected of them. An ideal platform will include affordances to assist new users in achieving these goals as they get started with the Dev Edmonton discussion list.

### Moderation

Moderation of any public forum is a challenge, and the selected platform should include tools for community members and adminstrators to report violations, respond and administer discipline in nuanced and proportional ways, and to attempt to change and correct behaviours rather than exclude individuals.

We want everyone to feel welcome on Dev Edmonton's platforms and understand that reasonable adults may at times disagree. We strive to include all individuals whenever possible, and want our moderation tools to reflect this.

### Identity & Sign On

Recognizing that not all users have the same sign on preferences, a solution allowing users to register on our site using email & password, as well as accounts with other services (Google, GitHub, etc.) is ideal.

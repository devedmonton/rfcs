# Abstract

As the society has grown, we've recognized the need for a more permanent and long form discussion and collaboration amongst Dev Edmonton Society members, which complements the ephemeral and real-time discussions taking place on our Slack.

Specifically we're looking for a forum to allow Working Groups to conduct their business and vote on RFCs and motions. We're also looking for a venue where discussion can be archived and referenced in the future. This is unlike Slack where messages are lost after a week or so.

Given the size of our community whatever platform we use for discussions also needs to support community building and moderation in line with our Code of Conduct and Alberta laws. We also need to ensure that support for the platform is available in the future, that it's within our budget, and aligns with our broader values and objectives. As business of a private or sensitive nature may be discussed from time-to-time, we also need to be able to conduct private discussions.

We also need to make sure that it's easy for members to join the discussion using their existing profiles on GitHub or Google, as well as by registering an account with email and a password.

We've reviewed multiple solutions for our discussion lists, and are recommending Discourse based on it's ease of use, community building, moderation, permission, support, and hosting costs.

# Status
